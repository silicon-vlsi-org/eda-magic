Change what layers are displayed in the window

<H3>Shortcuts:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      Mouse buttons 1 and 3 pressed in the GUI window toolbar implement the
      <B>see</B> and <B>see no</B> commands for the layer represented by
      the toolbar button.
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Usage:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>see</B> [<B>no</B>] <I>layers</I>|<B>allSame</B> <BR><BR>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
         where <I>layers</I> is a comma-separated list of layers
	 in the technology, and may also be the character <B>*</B>
	 indicating all layers but not labels, <B>$</B> indicating
	 all layers including labels, <B>labels</B> indicating
	 only labels, <B>error</B> indicating DRC error paint,
	 and <B>subcell</B> indicating subcells.
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      The <B>see</B> command allows various layers in the layout
      to be made visible, including labels and error paint.
      With the keyword <B>no</B>, the command causes these layers
      to be made invisible on the display. <P>

      The keyword <B>allSame</B> is a special use and indicates that
      non-edit cells should be drawn in the same manner as the edit
      cell, rather than being drawn in the "pale" styles. <P>

      Undisplayed layers generally do not respond to commands such
      as <B>erase</B> or <B>select</B>.  However, network selection
      will select across invisible layers, and copying or moving
      such a network selection will alter the invisible layers as
      well as the visible.
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>see</B> is implemented as a built-in command in <B>magic</B>.
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Bugs:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      It should be enforced everywhere in the code that invisible
      layers cannot be altered.  This may require removing invisible
      layers from a selection after doing a network connectivity
      search.
